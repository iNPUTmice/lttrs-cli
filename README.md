# Ltt.rs for Unix

A very, very rudimentary implementation of a TUI email client that uses [jmap-mua](https://github.com/inputmice/jmap). It mostly exists for development purposes and to quickly test new features in `jmap-mua`. Code quality (especially in regards to the TUI) is currently pretty low.
